              FEBIO STUDIO - RELEASE NOTES

*****************************************************************

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   1.5   5/17/2021

===========================================================================

* This version addresses several issues with the auto-updater. As a result, this version cannot be installed through the auto-updater, but requires a fresh installation of FEBio Studio. After installing this new version, users will be able to continue using the auto-updater to update FEBio Studio to the latest version. 
* This new version also comes with an updated EULA (EULA version 4) that includes a new PRIVACY clause. This was added because FEBio Studio communicates with an external server in order to provide services such as the model repo and the auto-updater. As of this version, a universally unique identifier is also assigned to each installation of FEBio Studio and send to the external server. This UUID is used to accumulate basic statistics on FEBio Studio usage. No personal data is send, recorded, or shared by FEBio Studio or FEBio.
* This version uses a new version of Qt (version 6). CMakeLists have been updated to work more smoothly with both Qt5 and Qt6.
* Fixed several issues that affected HDPI monitors. 
* Several issues were fixed with the geometry point-to-point, extrude, and revolve tools and the meshing of geometry created using these tools. 
* The TetGen based mesher now preserves element partitioning.
* A bug, which could cause an infinite loop, was fixed in the triangulation algorithm that generates the render meshes for some of the primitives.
* A mesh inflation modifier was implemented that adds a layer of structured elements, while preserving the underlying mesh topology.
* The underlying multi-block mesh generator that many of the primitives use has been significantly improved. For most of the primitives the resulting mesh is not altered, however, the cylinder now produces a slightly different mesh, compared to the previous version. 
* The dogbone primitive uses a different meshing algorithm that does not have the mesh singularity in the curved section. It was noticed that the singularity could create artifacts in the results. In addition, mesh-zoning parameters were added for this primitive. 
* A cylindrical matertial axes generation option was added to the "Set Axes" tool. 
* The fiber generator tool can now also be used to generate material axes. This works by assigning the generated fiber to the local "x" axis, and then generating an orthogonal coordinate system. For shells, the local "z" axis will be aligned with the shell normal. 
* A bug that could crash FEBio Studio was fixed in the "Axes from Curvature" tool.
* The Convert tool on the Mesh panel will now only show available options for the active mesh.
* Support was added for exporting DataArray variables (with DATA_ITEM format).
* Some minor issues were fixed with importing VTK file to post side.
* Fixed issue with scrolling using the mouse wheel in the graph window. 
* Support was added for reading LSDYNA database files. (Go to File\Open, select the LSDYNA database filter, and then select the plot file).
